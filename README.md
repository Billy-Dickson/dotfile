# Preamble

I've recently installed  [Pop! OS](https://pop.system76.com) on my new laptops and I've been slowly re-learning bash scripting. I started programming about 25 years ago when I was at University studying computing.

This is fork of a mature project that extends the bash setup on my Laptops and any other computer I care to install it on, I'll be adding functionality time permitting. At the moment, I'm quite enjoying the whole process, as it help me re-learn languages and techniques that I once used on a daily basis, ones that I no longer do use in my current job.

It scratches my itch. :-)
