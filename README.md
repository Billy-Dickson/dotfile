## Preamble

I've recently installed  [Pop! OS](https://pop.system76.com) on my new laptops and I've been slowly re-learning [bash scripting](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/). I started programming at school about 35 years and later while I was at University studying computing.

This is fork of a mature project that extends the bash setup on my Laptops and any other computer I care to install it on, I'll be adding functionality when time permits. At the moment, I'm quite enjoying the whole process, as it help me re-learn languages and techniques that I once used on a daily basis, the ones that I no longer use in my current job.

It scratches an itch. :smile:
